# NextJS_Practice

I have been thinking about making my own toy project, since I've only experienced team projects (which is weired becasue it is usually the other way around for most people.).  
I remember learning the fundamentals of React, but I really only focused on the BE in all of my team projects so much that I forgot all the FE of web development.
So I thought that I would start studying FE again with NextJS, which is the framework our team chose in my last team project.  
I will start by applying to a course in udemy, about NextJS and React.
Because my English is a little rusty (a lot actaully), I will try to take down notes in English (thankfully the lectures are also in English)
