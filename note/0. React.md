# React

React is a client-side JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

you can say an app is "reactive" if things happen instantly, meaning you don't wait for new pages to load or actions to start.

basic web sites do not have that kind of user experience. they load html files to render stuff, and there is a slight blinking or loading in between pages.

custom HTML tags as building blocks are what make up a React app. With that, the code stays maintainable and managable. The library will do the heavy work like rendering and combining codes.
